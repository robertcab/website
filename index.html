          <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
          <p class="lead">This website was created in order to showcase the skills I have acquired in HTML and CSS. I hope that you enjoy your stay and please provide me with some feedback on improvements.</p>
          <p class="lead">The content is focused on my work experience, qualifications and achievements and serves as a tool for me to present these in a different format.</p>

          <div class="content"><h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p> I have over 9 years of experience in the testing field, where I have tested UIs and APIs mostly from a manual testing perspective. </p>
            <p>My exposure to UI testing has been on Web and Mobile testing (Android, iOS platforms and PWAs).</p> 
            <p>From an API perspective, I have tested XML based APIs through SOAPUI, RESTful APIs through Postman and HTTP calls through Swagger.</p>
            <p>In the positions I have held, I have led teams on an informal and formal basis and have been commended on my ability to do so. </p>
            <p>My responsibilities within these roles were focused on recruitment activities, capacity planning, environment troubleshooting and assistance in resolving environmental issues, reporting back to higher management, reviewing of test artefacts, guiding and mentoring team members and facilitating bug prioritization meetings, to name a few.</p>
            <p>I have worked in Agile environments for over 7 years, being part of high performance teams and being involved in high profile projects.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I can best be described as a family man, where I enjoy spending time with my wife and kids and enjoy the odd gaming event and car show with friends as well.</p>
            <p>Personal traits which I hold close to my heart are honesty and having a high level of integrity.</p>
            <p>I am a person who has a strong work ethic, meaning that I am reliable, dependable and an extremely hard worker.</p>
